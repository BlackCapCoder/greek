Well, I write code recreationally, and this is yet another language
that I'll probably never finish.


Have a look at the (code)[code] file to see what I'm up to.
Here's what it was at the time of writing:


```haskell
a : Int;
a = 0;

b : Int;
b a b c = 0x1AF;

c = '\n ;
d = "foo bar\"";

e = 0b010101 ;

a : ∀ a b c. ∃ d. Either a (∃ x. f b) c;


List : Type;
List a = Nil | Cons a (List a) ;


Yoneda f a = Yoneda (∀ b. Arr (Arr a b) (f b))
;
```

What's up with the semicolons? It actually started out as a
very boring imperative language. We might go back to that too-
I don't have a goal!
